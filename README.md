## Deliverable 1

### Topic
Housing Market in New York City

### Reason for Topic Selection
The housing market is hot in New York City. We are interested in exploring and potentially predicting how housing prices will increase over time. Since, New York City is a diverse city made up of very different neighborhoods (Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island), we are going to break down and compare them.

### Questions to be Explored
What does the housing market look like in New York City as a whole?
What does the housing market look like in each of the 5 neighborhoods: Brooklyn, the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island?
How do they compare to each other?
Can we predict how housing prices will change over time?
