## Deliverable 1

### Topic
Gentrification in New York City

### Reason for Topic Selection
Increasing awareness of gentrification is more important than ever. New York City, in particular, is seeing the benefits and damage of the city's gentrification. Some of these benefits include real estate prices, population size, median household income, educational attainment, the rental market are increasing. On the other hand, long-time residents can no longer afford to live in their neighborhoods and small businesses are being pushed out by large corporations. Gentrification is a complex topic, and predicting it can be useful in ensuring equitable development. 

### Questions to be Explored
How can gentrification be predicted?
What type of indicators contribute to gentrification?
What areas of New York City can be expected to gentrify next?
What is the history of the housing market to date and what may it look like in the future?
