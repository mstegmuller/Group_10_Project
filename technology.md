# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Data for the analysis portion of this project is sourced from Zillow.com and Census.gov. Zillow data provides home value indices, home values forecasts, and rental indices for the five boroughts of New York. Census data provides demographic information which includes population size, median household income, educational attainment, renters vs. buyers, and race. Pandas is used in Jupyter Notebook to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. The machine learning model is to be applied for further statistical analysis.

## Database Storage
The database will be stored in PostgreSQL using pgAdmin4.

## Machine Learning
The machine learning model will be developed in SciKitLearn. Linear regression, logistic regression, and decision tree models will be built to predict which neighborhoods within the five boroughs of New York are the most susceptible to gentrification.

## Dashboard
The code for the dashboard will be developed on a local drive using JavaScript and HTML, and the completed web presentation will be hosted on Heroku. Visualizations will be created with Mapbox and Tableau and integrated into the web presentation.
